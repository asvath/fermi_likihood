The program analysis_4_weeks runs the fermi likelihood analysis as described in : http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/scitools/likelihood_tutorial.html 

It performs the likelihood analysis on sources provided in a data list (can be changed in the cfg.py file) that are within a certain distance to a known fermi source. The sources also appear for a span of 4 weeks and disappear. 

If the resulting test statistic is more than 25, the program sends the user an email with the following details:
-Name of source
-TS value
-RA and DEC 
-Folder where source can be found
-The week number when the source had a TS >25.

Example of a line the data list:

102813   56.000 0.000000 0.226819 0.641252 -7.081667 0.659169 132.428574 50.868160 0.085570 0.000000 0.000000 -5.292000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 2
4.510000 0.772000 -14.117000 0.026695  sig_match_sorted_157_160.dat sig_match_sorted_161_164.dat   2.6695e-02    1261   1.3247229E+02   4.8867855E+01

The following columns are used
Healpix=0
RA=7
DEC=8
x=23 #column 23 contains a string with the weeks the sources appear/disappear*
distance=25 #distance to the nearest known fermi source

	*Example:

	# eg:	Healpix[col 0] 	Weeks sources appears[col 23]			Weeks sources disappears[col 24]

	#		444140   		sig_match_sorted_253_256.dat 	sig_match_sorted_249_252.dat   
    #	 	444140  		sig_match_sorted_253_256.dat 	sig_match_sorted_257_260.dat 


# Notice that weeks 253-256 are the weeks that the source 444140 appears. This source is repeated. 
The source is to be analysized for the weeks 253-256.

	Example:
	$python analysis_4_weeks


The analysis_4_weeks program contains the following fuctions:
1)gtselect.py
2)gtexmpmapcall.py
3)generatexmlfunc.py
4)makefunc.py
5)gtlikecall.py
6)tsfile.py
7)emailsy.py
8)gtbin.py
9)movefiles.py
10fermitute.py
10)cfg.py

******************************************************************************
gtselect.py

Given a fermi source, selects data based on radius of interest (ROI), energy range, time range 

	Example:
	$python gtselect.py healpix number,ra,dec,week1,week2

******************************************************************************
gtexmpmapcall.py

Creates an exposure map based on the event selected via gtselect.py and a livetimecube (livetimecube in steps of 4 weeks were created prior to this analysis)

	Example:
	$python gtexpmapcallfunc.py healpix,ra,dec,week1,week2

******************************************************************************
generatexmlfunc.py

Generates the xml file with the fermi sources found in the fermi catalog based on the event select via gtselect.py.The particular source that you are analysing is not in this file and needs to be added later using makefunc.py
	
This program also writes a log file, make.xmllog, noting if there are extended sources present. 
	Example of info in makexml.log:
		This is make2FGLxml version 04r1.
		For use with the gll_psc_v02.fit and gll_psc_v05.fit and later LAT catalog files.
		Creating file and adding sources for 2FGL
		Added 86 point sources and 0 extended sources

	Example:
		$python generatexmlfunc.py healpix,ra,dec,week1,week2

******************************************************************************
makefunc.py

Adds the source that you are analysing into the xml file generated by generatexmlfunc.py 
Also corrects the path name to any extended sources.

Example:
$python makexmlfunc healpix,ra,dec,week1,week2,distance
